With the rapid advancements in autonomous vehicle technologies, the seamless integration of such vehicles  into  diverse  urban  landscapes  becomes imperative. This research focuses on the challenges posed by the current state of Indian roads, addressing issues ranging  from  roadside  garbage  accumulation  and dysfunctional traffic lights to unlined roads and unmarked speed bumps. The primary objectives of this study are to enhance road safety and facilitate a smooth transition for autonomous vehicles in the unique context of India.
To achieve these goals, we propose a Real-Time Road  Monitoring  system  powered  by  Deep  Learning algorithms. This system aims to provide a comprehensive solution  by  dynamically  assessing  and  mitigating  the identified road issues. 
From  a  road  safety  perspective,  our  system transcends mere accident reduction by not only alerting drivers to potential hazards but also by capturing and storing information about these hazards. This stored data serves a crucial purposeâ€”it acts as a proactive catalyst for  informing  local  government  authorities.  By transmitting  this  comprehensive  information,  we empower authorities to take swift and targeted measures, effectively mitigating risks and ensuring the removal of hazards. 
Furthermore, the study emphasizes the importance of adapting autonomous vehicle technologies to the specific challenges  of  the  Indian  road  environment.  By considering these challenges in real-time monitoring, we aim to enhance the overall performance and reliability of autonomous vehicles on Indian roads.
